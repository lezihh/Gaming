                ‘More chillies,’ I tell the fat uncle behind the counter. He frowns at me as
                he drops some more chopped chillies on the toast he’s making for me. I
                shake my head. N
                ot enough.
                ‘I need more chillies. You can cover them up with the cheese,’ I tell him.
                He pauses, and I’m scared he won’t comply. But then, shaking his head,
                shrugging, he drops a good fistful of the green chillies on the toast and
                grates cheese on top of it.
                ‘Are you sure?’ Tanya whispers behind me, making me jump. ‘I know
                what chillies do to you. And it is not something you should subject the
                world to.’

                ‘Shut up!’ I whisper, looking around me at the college cafeteria.
                ‘Your eyes start watering and your nose becomes a disgusting mess,’ she
                says, in the way only someone who has known you since forever can say.
                ‘Ugh. Don’t remind me,’ I tell her, taking the plate of chilli cheese toast
                from the uncle. I smile as I pay him, but in my head, hundreds of ideas are
                whirring around.
                ‘Okay. I won’t. But I know that this isn’t for you,’ she says as she sashays
                away.
                I roll my eyes and follow her to the empty spot where she’s found a place
                to sit. She is, of course, not eating anything. Tanya follows a rather strict
                diet, and it doesn’t include cafeteria food.
                ‘Are you waiting for who I think you’re waiting for?’ she asks me as I
                settle down and look around nervously, my glance going back to the oily
                cheese toast which is hiding a battalion of chillies inside it.
                ‘Well, there he is,’ she whispers and straightens up. I pretend not to hear
                and don’t look up but every hair on my neck is screaming as it stands on
